## Project Overview
This is a gas-free cryptocurrency project built on the IOTA Tangle network. The goal is to create a completely feeless digital currency that can be publicly traded.

## Key Technologies
- **IOTA SDK**: For feeless transactions on the Tangle network
- **Next.js**: Frontend framework for the wallet and trading interface
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling

## Development Guidelines
- Always prioritize ZERO transaction fees in all implementations
- Use IOTA's native token framework for custom token creation
- Implement secure wallet functionality with proper key management
- Focus on user experience for seamless feeless transactions
- Ensure all trading mechanisms maintain the gas-free principle

## IOTA-Specific Notes
- IOTA uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) called the Tangle
- No miners or validators - transactions are validated by other transactions
- Native support for custom tokens without fees
- Use IOTA's Shimmer network for development and testing
